                        Hey you. <br><br>

                        June's been busy and July looks like it's only about to get busier. But you know what I want
                        most days in the morning, like on the one I'm typing this one out? Five extra minutes cozied up
                        in my blanket. Or…you know…make that ten. Wait, no, 15….and so it goes. <br><br>

                        Productivity, especially in this climate, is a hard thing to find the will for. Yes, the plans
                        are elaborate, and hypothetically, everything looks doable. But in the grand calculus of the
                        multiverse, well, plans hardly work. Now, I'm just being honest here. It's kind of a
                        multiversal truth ya know. What does work, when all else fails, is improvisation. You make a
                        plan, more like an outline, and you work out the kinks when we get to them. You improvise. Where
                        am I going with this? Well, you'll see. <br><br>

                        See improv is a skill, and not just a kind of stand up comedy. Thinking fast and acting on your
                        feet is a skill we must all cultivate, because if something doesn't work in the first go, we may
                        not always have the time to work on it right away. Notice that I said right away. There will
                        always be second chances, just not in the way you imagine. Some of them might come years apart
                        from the last one, and you might think missing them means the end of all of the chances at that
                        particular thing. This is where we look for the famous plan B. <br><br>

                        Where the improvisation comes in. But listen, even as we must learn to improvise and keep
                        ironing the issues out, we mustn't forget that there will always be second chances. You just
                        gotta watch out for them. So, even if you're not productive right this second, even if you want
                        a little extra time wrapped up in a blanket, you can have it. Just make sure you eventually do
                        get up. Kay? <br><br>

                        Now, if you're looking for second, first or even third chances, and you don't fancy getting out
                        of bed, we've brought a selection of chances right to you. Here you go! Think fast and grab your
                        chances before they run out. Seize the day, my friend! <br> <br>
