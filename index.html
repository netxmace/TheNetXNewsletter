                    If you can’t do it with feeling, don’t. 

                    Hey you! Missed us this last month? We did too! It's been a whole month without writing to you guys, and honestly, its been a rollercoaster of a month and there's a lot to say. <br>
<br>
                    
                    But the thing is though, recently, I’ve been finding it really hard for me to write in general. I mean, I love doing it, but lately…well. I’ve always known that writing is supposed to make you feel something. That’s the beauty of literature; it makes you think and feel. Kind of what I’m trying to do with this newsletter actually. But you can’t make people feel something without convincing yourself that you feel it first. It's like they say, to tell a lie convincingly, you need to convince yourself first. <br> <br>

                    
                    See, there’s this quote that I absolutely worship when it comes to writing, or doing anything, actually. Patsy Cline, this American singer from the 90s said it, and it goes, “If you can’t do it with feeling, don’t.” I usually like to go a step further with this and say, if you can’t do it with love, don’t. It’s that simple. You see, when you do something with love, you employ the biggest force in the universe to conspire and bring you something that is even if not perfect, damn satisfying. It’s hard to say no to that kind of effort, you know, the one filled with love? <br><br>
                    
                    Which brings me to this edition’s point. It’s easier to do something when you enjoy the process, and love what you do. While I am well aware that what you are currently doing might not be what you truly love doing, and that sometimes we will have to do things that we don’t fully love, finding a source of happiness and merriment in whatever it is that you do, finding a way to vibe with the process, that might take you a long way. Maybe shift your perspective a bit, and you’ll find an opportunity to mix business with pleasure, and you’ll find that you can have your cake and eat it too. If you change the way you look at things, the things you look at will change. And who knows, you just might end up liking what you see. Or even, well, loving it. <br><br>
