                        Hey, did you catch the blooming lilies? Well, I did. I saw a bright and graceful pair of white lilies standing proudly down my front yard. It got me thinking. It is almost mid-summer. Yep, that is right, it is May already. Labor day is here, while Mother’s day is just around the corner. And guess what? This is the 10th issue of The NetX Newsletter. Kudos to team TNN!!! We have come this far. It has been incredible helping people discover opportunities and encourage development in themselves. <br> <br>

                        Anyways, academically, we have finished another semester. I believe that we all can agree that the last few months have been chaotic. But we are here. Even those times have passed. So, why choose to have a stormy mind at all, right? Being mindful is the need of the hour. If you ask me why I only have one answer. I have realized that students choose stupid ways to cope when it gets demanding. Even their lives lose their value. To all those feeling empty inside, take a breath. Like Sean Maguire says in Good Will Hunting, it is not your fault. Here is a tip. Practice mindfulness. Try finding happiness in the things you do. If you do not, then that is probably meaningless. I hope you have not forgotten gratitude journaling. Start it today and see how your days get better. <br><br>
                        
                        Now is the best part. To enjoy May to its fullest, you need the best movies. Why not stick to the theme? Here are two films that reminded me that your decisions and choices can be changed. It is never late. But, it does take courage. <a href = "https://www.primevideo.com/region/eu/detail/0GHXFJSQN3M3RMSIEK8OFKPBGU/ref=atv_sr_def_c_unkc_1_1_1?sr=1-1&pageTypeIdSource=ASIN&pageTypeId=B01MFZWGD0&qid=1651403774">Good Will Hunting</a>  and <a href = "https://www.primevideo.com/region/eu/detail/Mona-Lisa-Smile/0S7WTIE86X84OODDYDZWSC1S7X?ext_vrnc=hi&ref_=dvm_pds_gen_in_as_s_gt_dsaallwebd_mkw_s-dc&mrntrk=pcrid_580559066110_slid__pgrid_67214826146_pgeo_20461_x__ptid_dsa-19959388920" >Lisa Smile</a>.

Also, do not forget to wish your mama a happy mother's day.

                        If you can’t do it with feeling, don’t.<br><br>

                        Hey you! Missed us this last month? We did too! It's been a whole month without writing to
                        you
                        guys, and honestly, its been a rollercoaster of a month and there's a lot to say. <br><br>

                        But the thing is though, recently, I’ve been finding it really hard for me to write in
                        general.
                        I mean, I love doing it, but lately…well. I’ve always known that writing is supposed to make
                        you
                        feel something. That’s the beauty of literature; it makes you think and feel. Kind of what
                        I’m
                        trying to do with this newsletter actually. But you can’t make people feel something without
                        convincing yourself that you feel it first. It's like they say, to tell a lie convincingly,
                        you
                        need to convince yourself first. <br><br>

                        See, there’s this quote that I absolutely worship when it comes to writing, or doing
                        anything,
                        actually. Patsy Cline, this American singer from the 90s said it, and it goes, “If you can’t
                        do
                        it with feeling, don’t.” I usually like to go a step further with this and say, if you can’t
                        do
                        it with love, don’t. It’s that simple. You see, when you do something with love, you employ
                        the
                        biggest force in the universe to conspire and bring you something that is even if not
                        perfect,
                        damn satisfying. It’s hard to say no to that kind of effort, you know, the one filled with
                        love?<br><br>


                        Which brings me to this edition’s point. It’s easier to do something when you enjoy the
                        process,
                        and love what you do. While I am well aware that what you are currently doing might not be
                        what
                        you truly love doing, and that sometimes we will have to do things that we don’t fully love,
                        finding a source of happiness and merriment in whatever it is that you do, finding a way to
                        vibe
                        with the process, that might take you a long way. Maybe shift your perspective a bit, and
                        you’ll
                        find an opportunity to mix business with pleasure, and you’ll find that you can have your
                        cake
                        and eat it too. If you change the way you look at things, the things you look at will
                        change.
                        And who knows, you just might end up liking what you see. Or even, well, loving it.
