                        September has flown by like a leaf in the wind, and the fall mood is here!!! It is hard to
                        believe that it is already October, the 10th month of the year, and we are nearly getting to the
                        end of this year. It feels like the days get shorter and the nights get longer. It is at this
                        time of year that we have begun to really settle into the daily routines of our life.
                        <br><br>
                        When it comes to October, no list is complete without Halloween. This is a western tradition
                        that we see a lot on Television, but it would have been exciting if we had a Halloween
                        celebration at college, right?? In addition to spooky revelry, the schedule includes multiple
                        days on the topic of bullying awareness. It also has days encouraging pasta-lovers to rejoice,
                        celebrate science and nature, pay tribute to teachers, and more.
                        <br><br>
                        This month of the year also holds some important national and international events. "Our time is
                        now - our rights, our future" is the theme for International Day of the Girl this year. We also
                        have World Teachers Day, World Mental Health Day, and World Animal Welfare Day this month.
                        <br><br>
                        While the fun of summer is fading from memory, fall is a time when many people turn over a new
                        leaf. October being a month of celebrations, is giving us a chance. Let us take a moment to
                        practice kindness. For the last few years, we have endured such hate. We must learn to give
                        affection. Be selfless because you can. Do not judge. Learn about other cultures because if you
                        do not, you will never know about the wonderful people who live all around this world. Be
                        respectful to all people. Why? Because the world needs more people who are. And there is no one
                        better to do this than ALL OF US!!
