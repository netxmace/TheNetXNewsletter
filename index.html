                        Hola amigos,<br><br>
                        Frosty November is already knocking on the doors. Ten months of 2022 have passed like nothing. I
                        cannot believe that a year of hard work, desires, and improvements will end soon. All these
                        distressing workloads to reach our expectations have been draining the youth out of us. Do you
                        not think it is high time we invest time in ourselves? I suggest we need to give a break to this
                        never-ending saga of exploiting our poor souls. Trust me, self-care is a must. Grant a little
                        bit of your precious time to hear, feel, heal, and nurture yourself.
                        <br><br>
                        Do things that feed your passion as November brings you the freshness of children's day. Keep in
                        mind that life is not all about growing up. Keep the child inside you alive to taste a life bit
                        sweeter.
                        <br><br>
                        Have you ever heard of Mother O Mine by Rudyard Kipling? It portrays the intense connection
                        between a mother and a child. I have realized that a child remains a child for his parents even
                        after graying. The warmth and support our well-wishers provide are incredible.
                        <br><br>
                        It is a truth that globalization has made the entire world more competitive, and this
                        competition can be scary too. Assuming that others are better than themselves can lead people to
                        depression. But there are two sides to a coin. Let us see what Bill Gates said.
                        <br><br>
                        “Whether it is Google or Apple or free software, we have some fantastic competitors, keeping us
                        on our toes.”
                        <br><br>
                        I think you guys got it now. He treats competition as a way to upgrade himself, a tool to make
                        him stronger. Take these into your mind and grab every chance which helps you to improve
                        yourself and makes you the best competitor.
