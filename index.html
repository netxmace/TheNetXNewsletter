                        Sitting on my veranda, sipping my morning caffeine dose,
                        Rhyming with the rhythm of the first light's gentle droplets,
                        Falling lazily upon the eager earth I've always yearned to own.
                        Oh, how I long for more Junes throughout the year!
                        <br><br>
                        June, the emblem of a second life,
                        Another chance to rectify past mistakes,
                        To embark upon a new chapter of love and hope.
                        June will see, adorable little ones stumble into the haunted house (called "School"),
                        Parallely, June will also witness, curious tots scurry through the market,
                        Gathering school supplies in their shopping carts.
                        <br><br>
                        June evokes fond memories of my mischievous childhood fairies, Betcy, Tacy, and Tib, who
                        whimsically exclaimed, "It is June, and the world is perfumed with the delicate scent of roses.
                        The sunshine cascades like powdered gold upon the grassy hillside."
                        <br><br>
                        On June 12 as we honor the enduring spirit of Anne Frank, whose words penned in her diary
                        continue to touch hearts and inspire generations.Let us kindle the flame of hope she ignited
                        through her poignant reflections, reminding us to cherish the power of compassion, resilience,
                        and the pursuit of a more inclusive world. It is the perfect dawn to voice yourself.
                        <br><br>
                        On June 19 as we honor the lovable, lasagna-loving feline, Garfield, on National Garfield the
                        Cat's Day! Let's embrace our inner couch potatoes, indulge in some delicious lasagna, and share
                        a laugh or two with Garfield's witty and relatable antics. It's a purr-fect day to celebrate the
                        world's most famous orange tabby and enjoy the humor and charm he brings to our lives.
                        <br><br>
                        June, with its extended rain-time and boundless opportunities, serves as a reminder to embrace
                        every moment and live life to the fullest. Let us wholeheartedly adopt this spirit of seizing
                        the day, spreading love and kindness in every step we take. Each day presents us with a fresh
                        canvas to paint beautiful memories and contribute positively to the world around us.Let's use
                        this God's gift for the betterment of ours and our neighbours souls.
