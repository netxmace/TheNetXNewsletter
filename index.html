                        Hey, did you catch the blooming lilies? Well, I did. I saw a bright and graceful pair of white
                        lilies standing proudly down my front yard. It got me thinking. It is almost mid-summer. Yep,
                        that is right, it is May already. Labor day is here, while Motherâ€™s day is just around the
                        corner. And guess what? This is the 10th issue of The NetX Newsletter. Kudos to team TNN!!! We
                        have come this far. It has been incredible helping people discover opportunities and encourage
                        development in themselves. <br> <br>

                        Anyways, academically, we have finished another semester. I believe that we all can agree that
                        the last few months have been chaotic. But we are here. Even those times have passed. So, why
                        choose to have a stormy mind at all, right? Being mindful is the need of the hour. If you ask me
                        why I only have one answer. I have realized that students choose stupid ways to cope when it
                        gets demanding. Even their lives lose their value. To all those feeling empty inside, take a
                        breath. Like Sean Maguire says in Good Will Hunting, it is not your fault. Here is a tip.
                        Practice mindfulness. Try finding happiness in the things you do. If you do not, then that is
                        probably meaningless. I hope you have not forgotten gratitude journaling. Start it today and see
                        how your days get better. <br><br>

                        Now is the best part. To enjoy May to its fullest, you need the best movies. Why not stick to
                        the theme? Here are two films that reminded me that your decisions and choices can be changed.
                        It is never late. But, it does take courage. <a
