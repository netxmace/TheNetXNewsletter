                        2023!!! Here you are!! With great promises, the new year has arrived. Can't wait to see what you
                        have in store for all of us. 2022, you have been eventful and challenging. Some of us had the
                        most incredible year, while many people struggled at some point in time over the last
                        year.
                        <br><br>
                        Even though Covid eased during the last year, we saw the dramatic effects of climate change,
                        with record-breaking natural disasters in many parts of the world. Russia invaded Ukraine on
                        24th February 2022, resulting in thousands of deaths on both sides. Queen Elizabeth II, the
                        longest-reigning British monarch, died. A twenty-two-year-old Kurdish-Iranian woman, Mahsa
                        Amini, died in police custody after being arrested for failing to cover her hair. The
                        humanitarian crisis in Syria, Afghanistan, South Sudan, and Yemen deepened.
                        <br><br>
                        Despite these challenges, we also saw some inspiring moments. After long years of oppression,
                        more than 90000 Iranians marched as one to the slogan: "Women, life, freedom!". Countries agreed
                        on climate and biodiversity funding. NASA launched the James Webb Space Telescope, giving us
                        some of the most beautiful space pictures. The UK got its first Indian-origin PM, Elon Musk took
                        over Twitter, and Taylor Swift released her tenth studio album. Above all, Lionel Messi took
                        Argentina to the World Cup to lift it.
                        <br><br>
                        So it's true. 2022 has been incredible and hurtful. As we enter into the new year, let me assure
                        you. This year isn't going to be a fairytale. There will be difficult times. It takes
                        determination and aspiration to reach where you want to go. Many of us have made many tough
                        decisions over the past year. We should all be proud of our efforts and support one another.
                        Just take a moment to reflect on your experiences and accomplishments over the past twelve
                        months. Let's use this opportunity to re-examine our values, goals and priorities.<br><br>
                        It is the Holidays. Give rest to your body and soul. You owe to give them rest. Reflect on the
                        inner you. Listen to its silent wishes. Do those silly crafts which make you feel content. Sing
                        your heart out. Hop to the carol chorus. Enjoy the Christmas special matinee shows and make your
                        own little straw hut for the savior, the salvage.
