                        What does June remind you of? Is it the heavy rains or the winds? Or maybe, it is the warmth
                        around an environment day or the comfort you feel close to a Father's Day? Whatever it is, June
                        is just exquisite. Did you notice that the monsoons came earlier this year? It was a little
                        unusual to see the heavy downpour in May. Well, what can you say? Climate change is real. It was
                        this real when Leo said that in his Oscar acceptance speech. It was existent when Greta started
                        Fridays for Future. And it is the same still.

                        <br><br>

                        This is the time to act, is it not? This environment day, let us make decisions to change the
                        future of our planet. Let us rebuild our beautiful nature for the generations to come. Next time
                        you try to throw that chocolate wrapper away on the sidewalk, do not. Next time you leave the
                        tap open while brushing, do not. These little things can make a huge difference. Remember, it is
                        our responsibility to REIMAGINE, RECREATE AND RESTORE. After all, we are engineers.

                        <br><br>

                        Also, do not forget to celebrate Father’s Day this June 19th. Take a break and wish your dad.

                        I have one question for all those who keep postponing their chances for tomorrow. Accurately, it
                        is Eminem's question. If you had one opportunity to seize everything you ever wanted would you
                        capture it or let it slip? Jam to <a

                            Nights</a> and grab that next opportunity. Do not hold back.
                        Until next time, adios.
