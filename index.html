                        Hurray! The chimes of Big Ben rang!! It is Christmas!! Grab all your mischievous collections and
                        hold them tight. I hope Papa Noel will not refuse to offer us a sledge ride.

                        The portly, jolly, white-bearded man in a red coat with a white fur collar and cuffs, red
                        trousers, hat, black leather belt, and boots bringing a handful of candies to the well-behaved
                        children, my Papa Noel never ceased to fascinate me.
                        <br><br>
                        Christmas induces joy and festivity in the family atmosphere. The aromas and the sounds of
                        Christmas make the children rush home from school.
                        Grandpa would put on Christmas carols, and Grandma would tap her feet to the beat as she mixed
                        the batter, pounded dough, and fried, baked and molded treats for the family and all the
                        neighbors. Dad and Mom would decorate the house in the evenings after work, and children would
                        chant “Jingle bells, jingle bells!! Jingle all the way!!” until they faint. The air is cold and
                        freezing. Anyone can feel the aroma of mindfully crafted plums and greeting cards. Messengers of
                        love and peace are sent to the boundaries of the planet. Christ, the Redeemer, is born on my
                        little straw hut.

                        With December, the Two Thousand Twenty-Two ( (TTTT)2022) dies. The love, affection, break-up,
                        agony, frustration, fear, happiness and peace of 2022 will drown in the depths of Mariana.

                        It is the Holidays. Give rest to your body and soul. You owe to give them rest. Reflect on the
                        inner you. Listen to its silent wishes. Do those silly crafts which make you feel content. Sing
                        your heart out. Hop to the carol chorus. Enjoy the Christmas special matinee shows and make your
                        own little straw hut for the savior, the salvage.

                        It is time for a Christmas resolution. I made mine. What about you? Still, waiting for the Ghost
                        of Christmas past, present and future to come your way and lead your path..huh..? Waiting like
                        Mr Scrooge for the day of compunction…? Why wait? No more waits!! Hop on to NetX. Let us change
