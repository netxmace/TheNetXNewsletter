                            Hey you! Missed us this last month? We did too! It's been a whole month without writing to
                            you
                            guys, and honestly, its been a rollercoaster of a month and there's a lot to say. <br><br>

                            But the thing is though, recently, I’ve been finding it really hard for me to write in
                            general.
                            I mean, I love doing it, but lately…well. I’ve always known that writing is supposed to make
                            you
                            feel something. That’s the beauty of literature; it makes you think and feel. Kind of what
                            I’m
                            trying to do with this newsletter actually. But you can’t make people feel something without
                            convincing yourself that you feel it first. It's like they say, to tell a lie convincingly,
                            you
                            need to convince yourself first. <br><br>

                            See, there’s this quote that I absolutely worship when it comes to writing, or doing
                            anything,
                            actually. Patsy Cline, this American singer from the 90s said it, and it goes, “If you can’t
                            do
                            it with feeling, don’t.” I usually like to go a step further with this and say, if you can’t
                            do
                            it with love, don’t. It’s that simple. You see, when you do something with love, you employ
                            the
                            biggest force in the universe to conspire and bring you something that is even if not
                            perfect,
                            damn satisfying. It’s hard to say no to that kind of effort, you know, the one filled with
                            love?<br><br>


                            Which brings me to this edition’s point. It’s easier to do something when you enjoy the
                            process,
                            and love what you do. While I am well aware that what you are currently doing might not be
                            what
                            you truly love doing, and that sometimes we will have to do things that we don’t fully love,
                            finding a source of happiness and merriment in whatever it is that you do, finding a way to
                            vibe
                            with the process, that might take you a long way. Maybe shift your perspective a bit, and
                            you’ll
                            find an opportunity to mix business with pleasure, and you’ll find that you can have your
                            cake
                            and eat it too. If you change the way you look at things, the things you look at will
                            change.
                            And who knows, you just might end up liking what you see. Or even, well, loving it.
