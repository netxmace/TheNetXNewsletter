                        Can you believe it? It’s August already. I still feel like yesterday was New Year’s. Have you
                        noticed? Even though time flies, classes take forever. It’s nerve-wracking. But, I have to
                        admit. I have mastered the act of sleeping with my eyes open. Lectures are as tedious as they
                        used to be, and we are as bored as every student. I know you feel like you can’t do it anymore –
                        like you can’t bear this for another day. Well, just remember, good days will come. Don’t hate
                        life. Find the casual magic – the little things that make us happy. I am sure you can cope. This
                        is August. Find new hobbies and make new acquaintances. You have no idea how life-changing this
                        could be. <br><br>

                        Talking about hobbies, here’s one fact. Every year, the 9th of August is celebrated as National
                        Book Lovers Day – a day to celebrate us bibliophiles who find comfort in books and literature.
                        Well, I have a challenge for every one of you. On this 9th of August, put down your gadgets for
                        a little while. Start that book you always wanted to read. Or complete a book that you’ve been
                        reading. For anyone looking for a new book, here are two. “You’re Too Good To Feel This Bad” by
                        Nate Dallas for non-fiction lovers and “And Then There Were None” by Agatha Christie for people
                        looking for some fiction time. Take up the challenge. Let us take a short break from Instagram
                        reels and Netflix chills. Exploit this blessing of a <a href="https://1lib.in/">website</a> to
                        find and read books.
                        <br><br>
                        There are hardly five months left in 2022. Don’t waste your time and regret it later. Take a
                        risk and go through that door in front of you. Here’s our share of opportunities for you. Also,
                        here’s a note for anyone having a tough time. Pain leaves once it’s done teaching you. Have
                        hope, have strength – things will always get better. Have a happy August.
